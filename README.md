# Basic-Phising-Attack-with-Python
Basic Phising Attack, login mimicking LinkedIn **ETHICAL**


This project is a phishing simulation designed strictly for educational and ethical purposes, such as cybersecurity awareness training, red team exercises, or penetration testing in controlled environments. It mimics the LinkedIn login page and captures credentials using a Python backend to demonstrate how social engineering attacks work ‚Äî with the goal of helping users and organizations better defend against them.

DISCLAIMER:
This project must never be used for malicious purposes. Unauthorized phishing is illegal and unethical. Use this simulation only in environments where you have explicit permission, such as in training labs or ethical hacking coursework.

üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
Frontend (HTML/CSS):

The login page is styled to closely resemble the real LinkedIn login screen.

It includes fields for "Email" and "Password", along with buttons and links that mimic the original layout.

Basic CSS is used to improve visual realism and user experience.

Backend (Python):

A Flask server listens for POST requests from the login form.


How to run:
Clone repo,
pip install flask (in terminal)
python app.py (in terminal)
